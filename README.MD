## Odin Recipes

A very simple HTML project that serves as an entry page for a small recipe collection.

The page displays a heading and a list of links that navigate to individual recipe pages:

-   Lasagna
-   Mie Goreng
-   Bakso

## Purpose

This project is intended as a basic practice exercise for HTML structure, semantic elements, and relative links between pages.

## Structure

-   `index.html` — main page with links to recipes
-   `recipes/` — folder containing individual recipe HTML files

No CSS or JavaScript is used; the focus is purely on clean, readable HTML.
